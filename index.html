        <p><strong>About me</strong>: born in Germany, educated in Switzerland (B.A. International Affairs, University of St. Gallen) and currently living in Montr√©al, QC, Canada.</p>

<p><strong>I work as a</strong> Project Manager at the <a href="http://www.concordia.ca/research/migs/about/staff/nicolai-pogadl.html">Montreal Institute for Genocide and Human Rights Studies</a> at Concordia University, and a researcher at its <a href="http://www.concordia.ca/research/migs/projects/dmap.html">Digital Mass Atrocity Prevention Lab</a>. My professional focus is on projects and research at the intersection of digital technology, international security, atrocity prevention, and human rights. More precisely, I  focus on tools and procedures for human rights groups to counter surveillance and suppression, and I am motivated to bring policy and tech professionals closer together.  </p>

<p><strong>Through my work</strong> I helped conceptualize and organize the <a href="http://global-diplomacy-lab.org/labs/5th-lab/">Global Diplomacy Lab in Montreal</a> and several other conferences and training programs at Concordia University, conducted research at the <a href="http://yourswissnexboston.org/post/127641578566/st-gallen-graduate-presents-research-at-mit">MIT Media Lab and the Harvard Berkman Center</a>, participated in several conflict and atrocity prevention hackathons, and advised two teams at a Stanford University <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/msande298/">Hacking for Diplomacy</a> course.  </p>

<p><strong>Throughout university</strong> I was active as an event organizer, IT admin and alumni representative for the <a href="www.symposium.org">St. Gallen Symposium</a>, a yearly conference which brings together students with +500 senior politicians, academics, and business executives. </p>

<p><strong>Additionally, I worked for</strong> social organisations, such as a hospice in the United Kingdom and a kindergarten for children with disabilities in Stuttgart, Germany. I am also a human retweet bot (<a href="https://twitter.com/nicolaipogadl">@nicolaipogadl</a>) and I use Snapchat (reluctantly) to stay in touch with my four younger sisters back in Germany.</p>

<p><strong>The best way</strong> to contact me is via email (<a href="mailto:pogadl.nicolai@gmail.com">pogadl.nicolai@gmail.com</a>), Signal or Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/nicolaipogadl">@nicolaipogadl</a>)   </p>
