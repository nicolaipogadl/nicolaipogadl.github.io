      <p><strong>About me</strong>: born in Germany, educated in Switzerland (B.A. International Affairs, University of St. Gallen) and currently living in Montr√©al, QC, Canada.</p>

<p><strong>My interests</strong> revolve around (digital) technology and conflict (analysis) - topics I work on as a Research Fellow at the <a href="http://www.concordia.ca/research/migs.html">Montreal Institute for Genocide and Human Rights Studies </a>, Concordia University. More precisely, I focus on tools and procedures for activists and human rights groups to counter suppression and surveillance.</p>

<p><strong>Throughout university</strong> I was active as an event organizer and alumni representative for the <a href="www.symposium.org">St. Gallen Symposium</a>, a yearly conference which brings together students with leading politicians, academics, and business executives. Additionally, I worked for social organisations, such as a hospice in the United Kingdom and a kindergarten for children with disabilities in Stuttgart, Germany. I am also a human retweet bot (<a href="https://twitter.com/nicolaipogadl">@nicolaipogadl</a>) and I use Snapchat (reluctantly) to stay in touch with my four younger sisters.</p>

<p><strong>I use</strong> a <a href="https://github.com/nicolaipogadl/info/wiki">github-wiki </a> to collect interesting stories (it also serves as a mental garbage collection). </p>

<p><strong>The best way</strong> to contact me is via email: pogadl -dot- nicolai - at - gmail -dot- com </p>
