        <p><strong>About me</strong>: born in Germany, educated in Switzerland (B.A. International Affairs, University of St. Gallen) and currently living in Montréal, QC, Canada.</p>

<p><strong>My interests</strong> revolve around (digital) technology and conflict (analysis) - topics I work on as a Research Fellow at the <a href="http://www.concordia.ca/research/migs.html">Montreal Institute for Genocide and Human Rights Studies, Concordia University</a>. More precisely, I focus on tools and procedures for citizens, activists and human rights groups to counter suppression and surveillance in conflict ridden countries.</p>

<p><strong>This summer</strong> I will conduct research on Sub-Saharan African conflicts and the difference of framing and agenda-setting between U.S. Mainstream Media and local media outlets; my colleague Marie Lamensch and I were accepted to be funded through the <a href="http://mediacloud.org/2015/04/30/cfp-media-cloud-data-challenge/">Media Cloud Data Challenge</a>, a collaboration between the Harvard Berkman Centre and the MIT Centre for Civic Media and the Ford Foundation. Additionally, I was kindly offered an <a href="http://www.aspeninstitute.org/events/2015/07/10/socrates-program-2015-summer-seminars">Aspen Institute Socrates Seminar</a> Scholarship to learn more about U.S foreign policy, ISIS, and Jihad 2.0. </p>

<p><strong>Throughout university</strong> I was active as an event organizer, IT admin and alumni representative for the <a href="www.symposium.org">St. Gallen Symposium</a>, a yearly conference which brings together students with leading politicians, academics, and business executives. Additionally, I worked for social organisations, such as a hospice in the United Kingdom and a kindergarten for children with disabilities in Stuttgart, Germany. I am also a human retweet bot (<a href="https://twitter.com/nicolaipogadl">@nicolaipogadl</a>) and I use Snapchat (reluctantly) to stay in touch with my four younger sisters back in Germany.</p>

<p><strong>I plan to use a</strong> <a href="https://github.com/nicolaipogadl/info/wiki">github-wiki </a> to collect and write stories. </p>

<p><strong>The best way</strong> to contact me is via email (<a href="mailto:pogadl.nicolai@gmail.com">pogadl.nicolai@gmail.com</a> or <a href="mailto:nicolaipogadl@riseup.net">nicolaipogadl@riseup.net</a> -&gt; <a href="https://github.com/nicolaipogadl/PGP-PUBLIC-KEY/wiki">PGP PUBLIC KEY</a>) or Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/nicolaipogadl">@nicolaipogadl</a>)   </p>
