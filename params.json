More precisely, I focus on tools and procedures for activists and human rights groups to counter suppression and surveillance.\r\n\r\n**Throughout university** I was active as an event organizer and alumni representative for the [St. Gallen Symposium](www.symposium.org), a yearly conference which brings together students with leading politicians, academics, and business executives. Additionally, I worked for social organisations, such as a hospice in the United Kingdom and a kindergarten for children with disabilities in Stuttgart, Germany. I am also a human retweet bot ([@nicolaipogadl](https://twitter.com/nicolaipogadl)) and I use Snapchat (reluctantly) to stay in touch with my four younger sisters.\r\n\r\n**I use a** [github-wiki ](https://github.com/nicolaipogadl/info/wiki) to collect and write stories (it also serves as a mental garbage collection). \r\n\r\n**The best way** to contact me is via email: pogadl -dot- nicolai - at - gmail -dot- com \r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
