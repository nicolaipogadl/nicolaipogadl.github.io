  "body": "**About me**: born in Germany, educated in Switzerland (B.A. International Affairs, University of St. Gallen) and currently living in MontrÃ©al, QC, Canada.\r\n\r\n**My interests** revolve around (digital) technology and conflict (analysis) - topics I work on as a Project Manager at the [Montreal Institute for Genocide and Human Rights Studies, Concordia University](http://www.concordia.ca/research/migs.html). More precisely, at its newly launched Digital Mass Atrocity Prevention Lab, I focus on tools, procedures, and policies which could support citizens, activists, and human rights groups and counter suppression and surveillance.\r\n\r\n**This summer** I conducted research on Sub-Saharan African conflicts and the difference of framing and agenda-setting between U.S. Mainstream Media and local media outlets; my colleague Marie Lamensch and I were accepted to be funded through the [Media Cloud Data Challenge](http://mediacloud.org/2015/04/30/cfp-media-cloud-data-challenge/), a collaboration between the Harvard Berkman Centre and the MIT Centre for Civic Media and the Ford Foundation. Additionally, I was kindly offered an [Aspen Institute Socrates Seminar](http://www.aspeninstitute.org/events/2015/07/10/socrates-program-2015-summer-seminars) Scholarship to learn more about U.S foreign policy, ISIS, and Jihad 2.0. \r\n\r\n**Throughout university** I was active as an event organizer, IT admin and alumni representative for the [St. Gallen Symposium](www.symposium.org), a yearly conference which brings together students with leading politicians, academics, and business executives. Additionally, I worked for social organisations, such as a hospice in the United Kingdom and a kindergarten for children with disabilities in Stuttgart, Germany. I am also a human retweet bot ([@nicolaipogadl](https://twitter.com/nicolaipogadl)) and I use Snapchat (reluctantly) to stay in touch with my four younger sisters back in Germany.\r\n\r\n**The best way** to contact me is via email (pogadl.nicolai@gmail.com or nicolaipogadl@riseup.net -> [PGP PUBLIC KEY](https://github.com/nicolaipogadl/PGP-PUBLIC-KEY/blob/master/PGP%20PUBLIC%20KEY)) or Twitter ([@nicolaipogadl](https://twitter.com/nicolaipogadl))   \r\n",
