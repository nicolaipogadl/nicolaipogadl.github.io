{"name":"Net(z) Home of Nicolai Pogadl","tagline":"International Affairs, Conflict, and Technology","body":"**About me**: born in Germany, educated in Switzerland (B.A. International Affairs, University of St. Gallen) and currently living in Montr√©al, QC, Canada.\r\n\r\n**My interests** revolve around (digital) technology and conflict (analysis) - topics I work on as a Research Fellow at the [Montreal Institute for Genocide and Human Rights Studies, Concordia University](http://www.concordia.ca/research/migs.html). More precisely, I focus on tools and procedures for citizens, activists and human rights groups to counter suppression and surveillance in conflict ridden countries.\r\n\r\n**This summer** I will conduct research on Sub-Saharan African conflicts and the difference of framing and agenda-setting between U.S. Mainstream Media and local media outlets; my colleague Marie Lamensch and I were accepted to be funded through the Media Cloud Data Challenge, a collaboration between the [Media Cloud Data Challenge](http://mediacloud.org/2015/04/30/cfp-media-cloud-data-challenge/) Harvard Berkman Centre and the MIT Centre for Civic Media. Additionally, I was kindly offered an [Aspen Institute Socrates Seminar](http://www.aspeninstitute.org/events/2015/07/10/socrates-program-2015-summer-seminars) Scholarship to learn more about U.S foreign policy, ISIS, and Jihad 2.0. \r\n\r\n**Throughout university** I was active as an event organizer, IT admin and alumni representative for the [St. Gallen Symposium](www.symposium.org), a yearly conference which brings together students with leading politicians, academics, and business executives. Additionally, I worked for social organisations, such as a hospice in the United Kingdom and a kindergarten for children with disabilities in Stuttgart, Germany. I am also a human retweet bot ([@nicolaipogadl](https://twitter.com/nicolaipogadl)) and I use Snapchat (reluctantly) to stay in touch with my four younger sisters back in Germany.\r\n\r\n**I paln to use a** [github-wiki ](https://github.com/nicolaipogadl/info/wiki) to collect and write stories. \r\n\r\n**The best way** to contact me is via email: pogadl.nicolai@gmail.com \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
