**I was born in** Germany, studied in Switzerland and currently live in Canada.

**At the Canadian International Council** in [Toronto](https://thecic.org/about/) I help to engage Canadians in the national conversation on international issues - the CIC's mission since 1928.  

**From 2015 to 2018** I worked as a project manager at the [Montreal Institute for Genocide and Human Rights Studies](http://www.concordia.ca/research/migs/) and the [Digital Mass Atrocity Prevention Lab](http://www.concordia.ca/research/migs/projects/dmap.html) at Concordia University in Montreal. 

**Past work includes** conducting a transatlantic project on the impact of machine learning on global affairs, organizing a [Global Diplomacy Lab in Montreal](http://global-diplomacy-lab.org/labs/5th-lab/) and several conferences and training programs. I also conducted summer-research at the [MIT Media Lab and the Harvard Berkman Center](http://yourswissnexboston.org/post/127641578566/st-gallen-graduate-presents-research-at-mit), participated in several conflict and atrocity prevention hackathons, and advised two teams at a Stanford University [Hacking for Diplomacy](http://web.stanford.edu/class/msande298/) course.  

**Throughout university** I was active as an event organizer, IT project leader and alumni representative for the [St. Gallen Symposium](www.symposium.org), a yearly conference which brings together graduate students with  more than 300 senior politicians, academics, and business executives. 

**Before university, I worked for** several social organisations, for example a hospice in the United Kingdom and a kindergarten for children with disabilities in Germany.
