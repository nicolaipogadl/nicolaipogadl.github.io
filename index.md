**About me**: born in Germany, educated in Switzerland (B.A. International Affairs, University of St. Gallen) and currently living in Montr√©al, QC, Canada.

**I work as a** Project Manager at the [Montreal Institute for Genocide and Human Rights Studies](http://www.concordia.ca/research/migs/about/staff/nicolai-pogadl.html) at Concordia University, and a researcher at its [Digital Mass Atrocity Prevention Lab](http://www.concordia.ca/research/migs/projects/dmap.html). My professional focus is on projects and research at the intersection of digital technology, international security, atrocity prevention, and human rights. More precisely, I  focus on tools and procedures for human rights groups to counter surveillance and suppression, and I am motivated to bring policy and tech professionals closer together.  

**Through my work** I helped conceptualize and organize the [Global Diplomacy Lab in Montreal](http://global-diplomacy-lab.org/labs/5th-lab/) and several other conferences and training programs at Concordia University, conducted research at the [MIT Media Lab and the Harvard Berkman Center](http://yourswissnexboston.org/post/127641578566/st-gallen-graduate-presents-research-at-mit), participated in several conflict and atrocity prevention hackathons, and advised two teams at a Stanford University [Hacking for Diplomacy](http://web.stanford.edu/class/msande298/) course.  

**Throughout university** I was active as an event organizer, IT admin and alumni representative for the [St. Gallen Symposium](www.symposium.org), a yearly conference which brings together students with +500 senior politicians, academics, and business executives. 

**Additionally, I worked for** social organisations, such as a hospice in the United Kingdom and a kindergarten for children with disabilities in Stuttgart, Germany. I am also a human retweet bot ([@nicolaipogadl](https://twitter.com/nicolaipogadl)) and I use Snapchat (reluctantly) to stay in touch with my four younger sisters.
